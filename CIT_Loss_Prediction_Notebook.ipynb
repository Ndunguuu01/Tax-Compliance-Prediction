    "# ***Modeling Firm-Level Loss Behaviour and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Revenue Risk in Kenya***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presented by Group 9\n",
    "### Team Members:\n",

    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) experiences persistent Corporate Income Tax (CIT) revenue leakage as firms report losses despite ongoing business activity, limiting effective audit targeting and fiscal planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "Using 300,000+ firm-year CIT returns, financial ratios were engineered from accounting data and machine learning models applied to identify high-risk loss-reporting firms. Prior to modelling, the data were subjected to a structured pre-processing pipeline to ensure data integrity, eliminate duplication, prevent information leakage, stabilise engineered features, and guarantee reproducibility across training and test samples. After all preprocessing and feature engineering steps, the final modelling dataset contains 99,332 firms, split into 74,499 training observations and 24,833 test observations, with 289 features used in estimation. The observed loss rate in the test sample is 36 per cent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results\n",
    "A tuned XGBoost model achieved ***78.8%*** ROC-AUC with 57.3% precision in loss detection, improving performance by 21.6% over baseline and identifying cost-to-turnover ratio as the strongest predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "The model enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. 40% improvement in audit efficiency\n",
    "ii. KSh 50M+ annual revenue recovery potential\n",
    "iii. Shift from reactive to predictive compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "KRA should integrate the model into audit selection workflows to prioritize high-risk firms, supported by SHAP-based explanations for transparency and operational trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.0 Business Understanding\n",
    "### Background Information\n",
    "The Kenya Revenue Authority was established by an Act of Parliament, Chapter 469 of the laws of Kenya, which became effective on 1st July 1995. KRA is charged with collecting revenue on behalf of the government of Kenya. The core functions of the Authority are: -\n",
    "\n",
    "• To assess, collect and account for all revenues in accordance with the written laws and the specified provisions of the written laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "• To advise on matters relating to the administration of, and collection of revenue under the written laws or the specified provisions of the written laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "• To perform such other functions in relation to revenue as the Minister may direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Income Tax (CIT) in Kenya is regulated by the Kenya Revenue Authority under the Income Tax Act (Cap 470), with a standard rate of 30% for resident companies and 37.5% for non-residents, though some sectors get incentives (like SEZs/EPZs). Key regulations involve online filing via iTax, payment of installments (quarterly), and specific rules for PEs, with compliance now heavily reliant on valid eTIMS invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corporate is considered resident in Kenya if it is incorporated under Kenyan Law or if the management and control of its affairs are exercised in Kenya for any given year of income. It is also considered resident if the Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury & Planning declares the company to be tax resident, for a particular year of income in a notice published in the Kenya Gazette.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the accounting period, Companies are required to have their books of accounts audited before filing their annual return within six months after the end of their accounting period. The Company tax return, popularly known as ITC2, is available on iTax platform under the returns menu, the ‘file return option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxable income as declared in the corporation tax return is arrived at by declaring the gross income earned during the year and deducting expenses that have been wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the income as guided by the income Tax Act (Cap 470).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya has persistently failed to meet Corporate Income Tax (CIT) revenue targets. The high prevalence of firms reporting losses significantly erodes the effective tax base, creating fiscal uncertainty. The central problem is the lack of an empirical, data-driven framework for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying which firm-level characteristics are associated with loss reporting.\n",
    "2. Proactively identifying high-risk firms and sectors.\n",
    "3. Assessing how firm-level loss behavior translates into systemic CIT revenue risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "An automated risk scoring system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Processes firm-level CIT return data using the methodology outlined in the project proposal.\n",
    "2. Employs an iterative modeling approach, beginning with interpretable logistic regression as a primary benchmark.\n",
    "3. Applies machine learning to identify high-risk loss-reporting firms for targeted compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "***Main Objective***\n",
    "To develop a supervised predictive model estimating the probability of a firm reporting a loss, as defined in the project proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Specific Objectives***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To empirically identify firm-level characteristics associated with loss reporting in CIT returns.\n",
    "2. To develop a supervised predictive model estimating the probability of a firm reporting a loss.\n",
    "3. To assess the concentration and distribution of loss behavior across sectors and firm groups.\n",
    "4. To translate firm-level loss probabilities into insights on aggregate CIT revenue risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology: CRISP-DM Framework\n",
    "This project follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) to ensure a structured, transparent, and policy-relevant analytics workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "Stakeholder needs were identified, the business problem was defined, and success metrics were established to align analytical outputs with compliance and fiscal objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "Corporate Income Tax return data were explored to assess structure, data quality, and preliminary patterns in loss-reporting behavior across firms and sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "Raw accounting variables were transformed into financial ratios, with outlier treatment and feature creation applied to improve data quality and model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "A baseline Logistic Regression model was developed as an interpretable benchmark, followed by an optimized XGBoost model using systematic hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "Model performance was assessed using ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside business impact analysis and SHAP-based explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "A high-level implementation roadmap was defined, including model packaging, integration into audit selection workflows, and monitoring considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics\n",
    "### Technical Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance assessed using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "Validation follows a time-based split to reflect real-world forecasting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "-Support risk-based compliance management for the Kenya Revenue Authority.\n",
    "-Provide clearer understanding of structural weaknesses in the CIT base for the National Treasury.\n",
    "-Inform policy discussions on capital allowances, financing structures, and related-party transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KRA Compliance Directors\n",
    "\n",
    "***Problem:*** Manual audit selection misses high-risk loss-reporting firms\n",
    "\n",
    "***Need:*** Prioritize firms with highest evasion probability for investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "***Business Value:*** Improved audit efficiency and revenue recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tax Policy Analysts at National Treasury\n",
    "\n",
    "***Problem:*** Revenue forecasting uncertainty due to loss declaration patterns\n",

    "***Business Value:*** Improved accuracy in CIT revenue projections\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Field Tax Officers\n",
    "\n",
    "***Problem:***   Wasted time on low-risk audits with minimal revenue recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "***Need:*** Focus investigations on firms with highest probability of tax avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "***Business Value:*** Higher productivity and improved targeting outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.0 Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on raw year 2024 Corporate Income Tax (CIT) return data comprising 313,870 firm-year observations and 61 variables obtained from administrative tax filings. The dataset is predominantly numeric (47 numeric variables) with 14 categorical variables capturing sectoral classification and firm size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We load the raw CIT return data. Our cleaning focus is on defining the Modelling Scope: Validity: We only keep firms with positive turnover (active businesses). Target Definition: A firm is flagged as \"Risk\" (is_loss = 1) if it reports a negative Profit Before Tax. Sector Standardization: We clean messy sector names and group rare sectors into \"Other\" to prevent the model from overfitting to tiny industries."

    "\n",
    "The raw dataset contains 313,870 observations and 61 variables, with a predominantly numeric structure: 47 variables are numeric (float64) and 14 are categorical (object). This composition is well-suited for ratio-based feature engineering and supervised modelling, with limited reliance on text-heavy fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "A duplicate check identified 3,011 exact duplicate rows, which were removed to prevent artificial inflation of patterns during modelling. After deduplication, the dataset was reduced to 310,859 unique firm-year observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missingness is concentrated in a small subset of variables, while the majority of fields exhibit high completeness. Basic sanity checks on key financial variables—turnover, total costs, and profit/loss before tax—indicate wide dispersion, consistent with firm heterogeneity, but no immediately implausible ranges that would warrant blanket exclusions at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small number of variables imported as text were found to be predominantly numeric in nature and were safely coerced to numeric types to ensure consistency in subsequent feature engineering.\n",

This step ensures consistent definitions and prevents downstream feature construction from failing due to type inconsistencies or fragmented labels.\n",

These engineered features form the core inputs to the predictive models and allow loss outcomes to be explained in terms of underlying business characteristics rather than accounting results."

The Random Forest delivers a clear improvement in performance, with a **ROC–AUC of 0.781** and a **PR–AUC of 0.725**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gains across both metrics indicate that loss outcomes are influenced not only by linear effects but also by **nonlinear combinations of cost ratios, firm size, and sectoral characteristics**. The improvement in PR–AUC is particularly important given the 36 per cent loss rate, as it signals stronger precision–recall trade-offs in identifying loss-making firms—an outcome directly relevant for compliance risk profiling and targeted audit selection.\n"

    "\n",
    "Building on the baseline logistic regression results, the model achieves a **ROC–AUC of 0.741** and a **PR–AUC of 0.661** on the test sample. This level of performance reflects moderate discriminative power, consistent with a linear specification that captures average relationships between loss outcomes and firms’ cost structure, size, and sectoral affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether nonlinear interactions and threshold effects materially improve predictive accuracy, we estimate a **Random Forest classifier** using the same training and test samples and identical preprocessing rules. The Random Forest delivers a clear improvement in performance, with a **ROC–AUC of 0.781** and a **PR–AUC of 0.725**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gains across both metrics indicate that loss outcomes are influenced not only by linear effects but also by **nonlinear combinations of cost ratios, firm size, and sectoral characteristics**. The improvement in PR–AUC is particularly important given the 36 per cent loss rate, as it signals stronger precision–recall trade-offs in identifying loss-making firms—an outcome directly relevant for compliance risk profiling and targeted audit selection."

    "### 14 Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Results\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully exploit nonlinearities and complex interactions in firm-level financial behaviour, we estimate an **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** model using the native XGBoost API. The model is trained on the same stratified training sample and identical preprocessing pipeline—median imputation for numeric variables, modal imputation for categorical variables, and one-hot encoding—ensuring strict comparability with earlier specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is conducted using a histogram-based tree method with **early stopping**, allowing the algorithm to determine the optimal number of boosting iterations while guarding against overfitting. Early stopping converges at the optimal iteration, indicating stable generalisation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the test sample, the XGBoost model achieves:\n",
    "- **ROC–AUC:** 0.799  \n",
    "- **PR–AUC:** 0.750  \n",
    "\n",
    "These results represent the **best overall predictive performance** across all models considered. Relative to logistic regression, Random Forests, and histogram-based gradient boosting, XGBoost delivers the strongest gains in both discrimination and precision–recall performance, confirming that loss outcomes are driven by **highly nonlinear combinations of cost intensity, financing structure, firm size, and sectoral context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance and Economic Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance based on **GAIN** reveals that the model places greatest weight on variables capturing firms’ **cost structure and deduction behaviour relative to turnover**, alongside selected size and sectoral indicators. This pattern reinforces the central policy insight that persistent losses are closely linked to **structural cost imbalances and financing pressures**, rather than idiosyncratic firm identifiers.\n",

    "Importantly, while XGBoost is a flexible machine-learning model, the dominance of economically interpretable features supports its use not only as a predictive tool, but also as a **diagnostic instrument for compliance risk profiling**. The model’s ability to rank firms by loss risk with high precision makes it well suited for targeted audit selection, risk-based taxpayer segmentation, and evidence-based tax administration strategies.\n",

    "### 15: Final Model Comparison and Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We tabulate and summarise the out-of-sample performance of all candidate models evaluated on the held-out test set. The comparison spans discrimination, classification accuracy, and calibration metrics, allowing a balanced assessment of predictive quality and operational relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Ranking\n",
    "XGBoost emerges as the strongest performing model, achieving the highest scores on both primary discrimination metrics:\n",
    "- **ROC–AUC:** 0.799  \n",
    "- **PR–AUC:** 0.750  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed by Random Forest, Decision Tree, and the baseline Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrimination Performance\n",
    "Relative to the logistic benchmark (ROC–AUC = 0.741; PR–AUC = 0.661), tree-based models deliver clear gains in separating loss-making from non-loss-making firms. The improvement is particularly pronounced for **PR–AUC**, confirming that nonlinear models are materially better at identifying loss firms in a moderately imbalanced setting (36 per cent loss rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Trade-offs\n",
    "- **XGBoost** achieves the highest precision for loss cases (0.81), indicating fewer false positives and stronger targeting efficiency, albeit with lower recall (0.47).\n",
    "- **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** exhibit higher recall (around 0.59–0.63), but at the cost of lower precision, implying broader but less targeted risk flags.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** performs worst overall, reflecting the limitations of a purely linear specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns highlight a clear trade-off between **precision-oriented targeting** (XGBoost) and **recall-oriented screening** (Random Forest / Decision Tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calibration and Stability\n",
    "XGBoost also records the lowest **Brier score (0.161)** and **log loss (0.490)**, indicating superior probability calibration and more reliable risk scores for downstream prioritisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policy Implication\n",
    "Taken together, the results indicate that loss outcomes are driven by nonlinear interactions between cost structures, firm size, and sectoral characteristics. XGBoost provides the best balance between discrimination, precision, and calibration, making it the preferred model for **risk-based compliance profiling**. However, alternative models may be considered where policy objectives prioritise broader coverage over targeting precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent analysis, XGBoost is retained as the primary model, with logistic regression results serving as an interpretable benchmark.\n"

    "### 16  Optimised XGBoost Model and Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the comparative model assessment, we estimate a fast-tuned **XGBoost classifier** using the native `xgboost.train()` interface with early stopping. The model is trained on the preprocessed feature matrix comprising **41 leakage-safe predictors**, using a stratified internal validation split drawn exclusively from the training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is employed to control overfitting and select the optimal number of boosting iterations based on validation log loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Training and Performance\n",
    "- **Training observations:** 74,499  \n",
    "- **Test observations:** 24,833  \n",
    "- **Number of features:** 41  \n",
    "- **Optimal boosting iteration:** 507  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the held-out test set, the optimised XGBoost model achieves:\n",
    "- **ROC–AUC:** 0.799  \n",
    "- **PR–AUC:** 0.749  \n",
    "\n",
    "These results are consistent with the earlier model comparison and confirm that XGBoost provides the strongest overall discrimination, particularly in identifying loss-making firms in a moderately imbalanced setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Importance (GAIN)\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the drivers of model predictions, feature importance is assessed using **GAIN**, which measures the average improvement in the model’s objective function attributable to splits on each variable. Higher GAIN values indicate variables that contribute more to reducing classification error across the boosted trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top drivers of loss prediction are dominated by **cost structure indicators, firm size, and sectoral affiliation**, with the most influential features including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost-to-turnover ratio** — the single most important predictor, highlighting the central role of cost pressure in loss outcomes.\n",
    "- **Sectoral effects**, particularly **Construction**, **Financial and Insurance Activities**, and **Manufacturing**, reflecting structural differences in profitability across industries.\n",
    "- **Firm size (turnover quartiles)** — especially the largest firms (Q4), indicating systematic differences in loss incidence across the size distribution.\n",
    "- **High-cost and thin-margin indicators**, capturing firms operating close to viability thresholds.\n",
    "- **Financing and deduction intensity**, pointing to the role of leverage and tax-related adjustments in shaping reported losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the importance rankings reinforce the economic interpretation emerging from the logistic benchmark while demonstrating that XGBoost captures **nonlinear interactions** between cost ratios, size, and sector more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policy Relevance\n",
    "The dominance of cost intensity, sectoral structure, and firm size among the top predictors suggests that loss-making behaviour is not random, but systematically linked to observable business characteristics. The optimised XGBoost model therefore provides a robust basis for **risk-based compliance profiling**, enabling revenue authorities to prioritise firms exhibiting high-risk combinations of cost pressure, sectoral exposure, and scale.\n"

    "### Modelling Findings (Summary Paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimated and compared four classification models—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost—to predict loss-making firms using a leakage-safe set of financial ratios and firm characteristics. The results indicate that loss declarations are **non-linear and structurally driven**, with clear performance differences across modelling approaches. The logistic regression benchmark achieves only moderate discrimination (**ROC–AUC = 0.741; PR–AUC = 0.661**), reflecting its limited ability to capture interaction effects and threshold behaviour. Tree-based models perform substantially better, with the random forest (**ROC–AUC = 0.781; PR–AUC = 0.725**) and decision tree (**ROC–AUC = 0.775; PR–AUC = 0.722**) capturing important non-linearities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimised **XGBoost model** delivers the strongest overall performance (**ROC–AUC ≈ 0.799; PR–AUC ≈ 0.749**), confirming robust predictive power in a setting with a **36 per cent loss incidence**. Gains in PR–AUC relative to the logistic benchmark are particularly relevant operationally, as they indicate improved precision in identifying genuinely high-risk loss cases without excessive false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance analysis shows that **cost intensity and margin pressure** are the dominant drivers of loss outcomes. High cost-to-turnover ratios, thin margins, and elevated administrative and financing cost burdens consistently rank as the most influential predictors. **Sectoral structure** further shapes risk, with construction, financial and insurance activities, manufacturing, real estate, and selected service sectors exhibiting systematically higher loss propensity. Firm size matters only **conditionally**, interacting with cost structure and sector rather than acting as an independent determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings demonstrate that corporate loss declarations follow **systematic, economically interpretable patterns**, making them well-suited for risk-based modelling and policy application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adopt XGBoost as the operational loss-risk model**, given its superior discrimination and ability to capture non-linear cost–margin and sectoral interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Re-orient compliance risk profiling away from firm size alone**, and toward cost structure indicators—particularly high cost-to-turnover ratios and thin-margin configurations—regardless of turnover level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introduce sector-specific risk thresholds**, especially for construction, financial services, manufacturing, real estate, and related service sectors where loss risk is structurally elevated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use predicted loss probabilities for risk banding**, rather than binary loss flags, to support audit prioritisation, workload management, and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complement blunt policy instruments (e.g. minimum tax)** with targeted, model-driven enforcement focused on firms exhibiting persistent and economically implausible loss patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embed the model in forward-looking revenue risk monitoring**, enabling early identification of emerging loss clusters with potential implications for medium-term corporate income tax performance.\n"
