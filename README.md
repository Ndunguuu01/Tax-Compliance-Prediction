CIT Revenue Risk Modeling - Kenya 
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling framework for understanding firm-level loss behavior and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) revenue risk in Kenya.

📌 Project Overview
The project identifies financial and structural characteristics associated with loss reporting in CIT returns using data from 2017 to 2024. We use a combination of Logistic Regression and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to quantify fiscal vulnerability and improve revenue forecasting.
