    "### 9.  Data Preparation and Preprocessing Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 0 was completed successfully, yielding a clean, standardised, and leakage-safe modelling dataset. Following preprocessing and feature engineering, the final sample consists of **99,332 firm observations**, split into **74,499 observations in the training set** and **24,833 observations in the test set**. The resulting design matrix contains **289 explanatory features**, reflecting both engineered financial ratios and encoded categorical controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed loss rate in the test sample is **36 per cent**, indicating a moderately imbalanced classification problem. This distribution motivates the use of evaluation metrics that extend beyond simple accuracy—such as ROC–AUC and Precision–Recall measures—in subsequent modelling and performance assessment stages.\n"

    "### 10 Basic Model  Results: Interpreting Loss Drivers in Policy Context\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Factors positively driving losses:** Loss probability rises sharply with **cost-to-turnover (β=1.17, p<0.001)**, **financing cost intensity (β=1.88, p<0.001)**, **deductions-to-turnover (β=2.00, p<0.001)**, **employment costs (β=1.32, p<0.001)**, and **admin costs (β=1.01, p<0.001)**, confirming that structural cost and financing pressures are the dominant drivers of reported losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factors reducing losses:** **Larger firm size** significantly lowers loss risk—**Q2 (β=-0.15, p<0.001)**, **Q3 (β=-0.58, p<0.001)**, and **Q4 (β=-1.14, p<0.001)**—while the **thin-margin indicator is insignificant (p=0.91)** once full cost structure is controlled for.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sector effects:** Relative to Manufacturing, most sectors exhibit **lower loss probabilities**, notably **Financial & Insurance (β=-1.01, p<0.001)**, **Construction (β=-0.91, p<0.001)**, **Information & Communication (β=-0.51, p<0.001)**, and **Real Estate (β=-0.61, p<0.001)**, indicating Manufacturing’s structurally higher loss exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Size effect:** The monotonic decline in loss risk across size quartiles indicates strong **scale and resilience effects**, with large firms substantially better able to absorb cost and financing shocks than small firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Policy recommendation:** Compliance and policy attention should prioritise **high cost-intensity and high financing-burden firms—especially small manufacturing firms—rather than sector labels alone**, using cost-structure indicators as the primary risk screen.\n",

    "### 11 Model Performance Beyond the Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the baseline logistic regression results, the model achieves a **ROC–AUC of 0.741** and a **PR–AUC of 0.661** on the test sample. This level of performance reflects moderate discriminative power, consistent with a linear specification that captures average relationships between loss outcomes and firms’ cost structure, size, and sectoral affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether nonlinear interactions and threshold effects materially improve predictive accuracy, we estimate a **Random Forest classifier** using the same training and test samples and identical preprocessing rules. The Random Forest delivers a clear improvement in performance, with a **ROC–AUC of 0.781** and a **PR–AUC of 0.725**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gains across both metrics indicate that loss outcomes are influenced not only by linear effects but also by **nonlinear combinations of cost ratios, firm size, and sectoral characteristics**. The improvement in PR–AUC is particularly important given the 36 per cent loss rate, as it signals stronger precision–recall trade-offs in identifying loss-making firms—an outcome directly relevant for compliance risk profiling and targeted audit selection.\n"

    "### 12 Model Performance Beyond the Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the baseline logistic regression results, the model achieves a **ROC–AUC of 0.741** and a **PR–AUC of 0.661** on the test sample. This level of performance reflects moderate discriminative power, consistent with a linear specification that captures average relationships between loss outcomes and firms’ cost structure, size, and sectoral affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether nonlinear interactions and threshold effects materially improve predictive accuracy, we estimate a **Random Forest classifier** using the same training and test samples and identical preprocessing rules. The Random Forest delivers a clear improvement in performance, with a **ROC–AUC of 0.781** and a **PR–AUC of 0.725**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gains across both metrics indicate that loss outcomes are influenced not only by linear effects but also by **nonlinear combinations of cost ratios, firm size, and sectoral characteristics**. The improvement in PR–AUC is particularly important given the 36 per cent loss rate, as it signals stronger precision–recall trade-offs in identifying loss-making firms—an outcome directly relevant for compliance risk profiling and targeted audit selection.\n"
